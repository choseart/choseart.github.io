## Cindy Hose

Cindy's passion for painting can be traced back to her childhood where she spent a significant time covered in paint, while pouring paint on chianti bottles that she discovered one day in the trash...fast forward to today when she uses paint drippings to design jewelry, and admits she's addicted to the mesmorizing way the paint decides the path that will lead to an incredible work of art. She is passionate about her art and loves the passion it envokes in others. "If I can create something that brings joy and laughter into someones life, I've succeeded". She has four dogs and a huge garden that inspire her. When she's not painting, she enjoys hiking with her kids, renovating almost anything and traveling.

Acrylic pouring is a painting technique where acrylic paint is mixed with a pouring medium and then poured onto a surface. After the paint has been poured, the surface is tilted in each direction to let the paint flow. The colors interact in unpredictable and always interesting ways.
