## Back to Your Roots

The Earth is what we all have in common. But sometimes the ground is the most overlooked aspect of beauty in mother nature. Having our heads in the clouds is never a bad thing. But taking some time to look down once in awhile reminds us that there is more Earth can offer. Getting back to your roots is something everyone needs once in a while. I'm hoping my Earth theme will remind you just how beautiful our home actually is.
