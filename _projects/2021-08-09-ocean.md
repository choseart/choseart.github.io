## A Deeper Meaning

The ocean has always had a personal meaning to me, and I beleive most people have a deep connection with the sea. Something draws us to this calming yet magnificent display. Brilliant turquoise waves gently lapping against the golden shoreline call us closer. Gliding birds and breaking waves release us from our thoughts. Although I wish it were different, not all of us can visit this goregous stage mother nature has created for us.

So in the meantime, magically travel to the ocean with some of my favorite ocean pieces.
