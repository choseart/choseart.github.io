## Stopping to Smell the Flowers

While spending endless hours in my garden, inspiration strikes in even the smallest of places. Amazing annuals that use all of their strength to put on a show for you and the perennials that come back year after year to delight. Vegetables, fruits, and especially flowers of all kinds set the stage for one of my favorite themes.
