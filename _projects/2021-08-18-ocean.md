## A Deeper Meaning

The ocean has always had a personal meaning to me, and I believe most people have a deep connection with the sea. Something draws us to this calming yet magnificent display. Brilliant turquoise waves gently lapping against the golden shoreline call us closer. Gliding birds and breaking waves release us from our thoughts. Walking endlessly at low tide reveals fish, white sand, and your own feet through the crystal clear water.

One of my first paintings “Maragogi” was named after visiting my son's wife's family in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XiGWHKHuLs83wmXb8">Maragogi, Brazil</a>. Maragogi is one of the most peaceful, and stunning places in the world.

Although I wish it were different, not all of us can visit this gorgeous stage mother nature has created for us. So in the meantime, magically travel to the ocean with some of my favorite ocean pieces.
